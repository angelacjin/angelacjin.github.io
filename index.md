## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="index-profiile.jpg">

Hi there! I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by Rediet Abebe.

My current research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, and explores questions like: How do practitioners with limited statistical expertise scrutinize statistically-driven decision-making tools in the criminal legal system? 

Prior to joining Berkeley, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I had the privilege of working with and learning from Shuang Chen, José F. Martínez, Christina Delimitrou, and many others.

## News
* **Jun. 2022** - I am honored to announce that I have been selected to join the AI Policy Hub this coming Fall! 

* **Jun. 2022** - Very excited to be presenting Adversarial Scrutiny of Evidentiary Statistical Software in-person this month, at FAccT 2022! Looking forward to attending my first in-person conference and to meeting people there!
